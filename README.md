# Fortran-Plasma-Sheath-Simulation
A one-dimensional plasma physics sheath simulation developed in Fortran in which a plasma is bounded by two surfaces with a source in the center.  When an ion hits the boundary an electron-ion pair is inserted back in the source thereby resulting in a rapid steady-state.
